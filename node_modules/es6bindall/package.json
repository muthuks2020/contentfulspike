  "readme": "# es6bindall\n\nSimple function to bind multiple methods to an ES6 class's 'this' object. Intended as an equivalent to Backbone/Underscore's _.bindAll() method.\n\nI created this plug-in to get around a problem where an ES6 class method's context is not autobound to the class's object.  This is a particular point of pain for ReactJS when using this syntax.  (ReactJS's previous .createClass() syntax _did_ autobind a component's methods to the component's own context.)\n\n##Problem Code\nIn the code below, the ```close()``` and ```open()``` methods, which both call ```this.setState()``` will fail.  This is because those method's ```this``` object is not autobound to the component's context, so ```this.setState()``` simply doesn't exist.\n```javascript\nclass ExampleModal extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  close() {\n    this.setState({ showModal: false });\n  }\n\n  open(){\n    this.setState({ showModal: true });\n  }\n  ```\n\n##Workaround 1 - Bind method at call time\nOne workaround that I've seen suggests that you should bind the method when you're calling it, as shown below:\n```javascript\n// Example take from http://egorsmirnov.me/2015/08/16/react-and-es6-part3.html\nexport default class CartItem extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        <button onClick={this.increaseQty.bind(this)} className=\"button success\">+</button>\n    }\n}\n```\nThis certainly gives you the most flexibility, since you can call the method as either bound or unbound should you wish.  Still, it's a massive pain in the rear to remember to do this every time you call your method.\n\n\n##Workaround 2 - Bind all methods manually in constructor\nThe code below will work correctly because each method's ```this``` is manually bound to the component's context by a separate ```.bind()``` call in the component's constructor.\n\n```javascript\nclass ExampleModal extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.close = this.close.bind(this);\n    this.open = this.open.bind(this);\n  }\n  close() {\n    this.setState({ showModal: false });\n  }\n\n  open(){\n    this.setState({ showModal: true });\n  }\n  ```\n\nWhile an improvement over Workaround 1, that's still a lot of code to add to your constructor just to bind your methods.  And so...\n\n\n##Workaround 3 - Bind all methods manually in constructor with es6bindAll\n...and so, I borrowed an idea from Backbone, which has [a _.bindAll() function](http://underscorejs.org/#bindAll) (actually part of Underscore).  You can generally call this in your Backbone class constructors in order to bind the methods to the class object.  Following that idea, I've created es6BindAll as a simple function that binds a supplied list of method names to a supplied context (```this```).  It takes two arguments:\n\n1. The context (i.e an object) to which the methods are to be bound.\n2. An array of method names.  Those methods must exist in the current component/class, i.e. they can't be external functions.\n\nExample use:\n```javascript\nimport es6BindAll from \"es6bindall\";\n\nclass ExampleModal extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    es6BindAll(this, [\"open\", \"close\"]);\n  }\n  close() {\n    this.setState({ showModal: false });\n  }\n\n  open(){\n    this.setState({ showModal: true });\n  }\n  ```\n\n##Browser/Environment Support\nInternet Explorer 9 and upwards, plus all good browsers (i.e. any browser _not_ called Internet Explorer).\n\n\n##Development Instructions\nThere's not much source code to change, but if you must!\n\nFirst run `npm install` to update the dev dependencies, basically the Babel command line tool and its dependences.\n\nThe source code is in the src/es6bindall.js file, and is in an es6(ish) kind of format.  Run `npm run build` to have Babel transpile the code to es5 format to the project's main file, i.e. index.js in the root.\n\nAlternatively, you can run `npm run start` to have Babel watch the src/es6bindall.js file for changes.  Babel will then update index.js automatically, whenever you save a change to src/es6bindall.js.\n\n##Tests\nTests are built with mocha + chai.  Run with `npm run test`.\n\nTests check that a test method remains bound to its parent object after its been bound using es6BindAll (i.e. .bind() under the covers), even if the context is being overridden by a .call().  (.bind trumps .call() it seems.)\n\n\n##Update History\nVersion 0.0.9: 26 Oct 2016\nFixed regression bug with Array handling.  Returned to previous array handling code.\n\nVersion 0.0.8: 4 Oct 2016\n* Changed test suite from Mocha/Chai to Tape\n* Added test for method name supplied as a string\n\nVersion 0.0.7: 8 Sept 2016\n* Added error check for non-existent methods\n* You can supply a single string method as well as an array\n\nVersion 0.0.6: 6 August 2016.\n* Fixed issue where the function no longer being exported correctly in NodeJS (and possibly elsewhere).  This was caused by Babel 6 no longer exporting a default `module-exports`.  Fixed this by adding the [babel plugin add-module-exports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports) to the build process.  See there for more details of the issue.\n\n",
