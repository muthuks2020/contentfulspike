[Read this](http://markup.im/#q4_cRZ1Q) for more details.\n\n### Why should you care?\n\nIf you need to load up a file's source directly and have it available within your javascript, this loader is what you're after. For example, you could load up a svg file, parse out a path you want, and manipulate that with your javascript somehow. Or you could load up a json or text file. Or some other type of file that you came up with yourself. Whatever it is, as long as it's contents would be ok after being run through `JSON.stringify` (read: text files, not images or binary files), it will work just great with the source loader. And if it is a binary file, it will work great as well, but you won't be able to require it in your client-side js, just manipulate it through a plugin.\n\n### Installation\n\n`npm install source-loader -S`\n\n### Usage\n\nJust load it up in your webpack config like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      { test: /\\.foo$/, loader: 'source' }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can require it up in your main entry:\n\n```js\nconst fooFile = require('testing.foo')\nconsole.log(fooFile) // wow it's the contents!\n```\n\nAs an added bonus, this loader makes the buffered raw source available on the `loaderContext` object so that plugins can manipulate it in any way necessary.\n\nLet's break down how this could be done. Inside any plugin hook, you have a `compilation` object. You can get the `loaderContext` for any of the modules that webpack is processing through `compilation.modules` -- just find the one(s) you want by name. Now you have a large object which is an instance of the `DependenciesBlock` class, with a bunch of great information on it. You can find the raw buffered source under the `_src` property if the file was loaded with the source-loader.\n\nWondering what sets this loader apart from [raw-loader](https://github.com/webpack/raw-loader)? This is it. Both loaders expose the file's contents to be required by webpack, but this loader also exposes the raw source for plugin processing. It also does not try to stringify binary files (which can cause bugs), has tests, and is actively maintained, as a bonus.\n\n### License & Contributing\n\n- Details on the license [can be found here](LICENSE.md)\n- Details on running tests and contributing [can be found here](contributing.md)\n",
