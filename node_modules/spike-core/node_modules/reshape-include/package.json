Or maybe a `svg`. In these cases and any other where you are seeking to mix two files that are processed by different parsers, you can utilize the  `parserRules` config value. Example shown below:\n\n```js\nconst htmlParser = require('reshape-parser')\nconst sugarml = require('sugarml')\n\nreshape({\n  plugins: [\n    include({\n      parserRules: [\n        { test: /\\.sgr$/, parser: sugarml }\n        { test: /\\.html$/, parser: htmlParser }\n      ]\n    })\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nNote that anything not matched by a `parserRules` test will be parsed by whatever parser is being used by reshape from its primary config. So in the example above, the `html` test is unnecessary -- since reshape's default parser is `reshape-parser`, it will already use this for any file not matching `.sgr`.\n\nNote that *any* parser can be used here in theory, but it must output a valid [Reshape AST](https://github.com/reshape/reshape#reshape-ast). Feel free to make use of the [reshape AST validator](https://github.com/reshape/plugin-util#validatetreetree) if you want in the process.\n\n### Options\n\nAll options are optional, none are required.\n\n| Name | Description | Default |\n| ---- | ----------- | ------- |\n| **root** | Root path to resolve the include from | the file's path. |\n| **alias**| Object with alias mappings, each key is your reference and the corresponding value is the relative path to your file. { button: './views/button.html } | |\n| **parserRules**| Array of objects that can include the `test` (regex) and `parser` (fn) keys. See readme for further details | |\n\n### Reporting Dependencies\n\nThis plugin will report its dependencies in the standard format as dictated by [reshape-loader](https://github.com/reshape/loader) if you pass `dependencies: []` as an option to reshape when it runs. Dependencies will be available on the output object under the `dependencies` key. For example:\n\n```js\nconst reshape = require('reshape')\nconst include = require('reshape-include')\n\nreshape({ plugins: [include()], dependencies: []})\n  .process(someHtml)\n  .then((res) => {\n    console.log(res.dependencies)\n    console.log(res.output())\n  })\n```\n\nIf you are using this with webpack, reshape-loader takes care of the dependency reporting and you don't have to do anything üòÅ\n\n### License\n\n- Licensed under [MIT](LICENSE.md)\n- See our [contributing guide](contributing.md)\n",
