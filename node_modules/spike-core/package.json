Spike aims to be simple, efficient, and a pleasure to use.\n\nSpike certainly is not the only [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) out there, but in our opinion, it's the most powerful and easiest to use.\n\n> Spike is from the same [team](https://github.com/carrot) that brought you [Roots](http://roots.cx). The thinking behind moving past Roots is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/@jescalan/eaa10c75eb22). Please feel free to comment and contribute.\n\n### The Stack\n\nSpike is fairly strict in enforcing a default stack. However, the stack allows for quite a large amount of flexibility as all of the parsers are simply foundations that do nothing by default and accept plugins to transform code. Also spike's core compiler is [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), so you can customize your project with [loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html) and [plugins](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html). The inflexibility of the stack means faster compiles and better stability. We use...\n\n- [reshape](https://github.com/reshape/reshape) for markup\n- [babel](https://babeljs.io/) for JS and JS transforms\n- [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for CSS transforms\n- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) as the core compiler\n\n### Features\n\n- Easy configuration via the `app.js` file\n- Integration with [Webpack's](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) massive plugin/loader ecosystem\n- Support for ES6 in your client-side JS via Babel\n- PostCSS default means extensive flexibility in CSS syntax and tools\n- Reshape default means the same for your HTML\n- Breezy local development powered by [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)\n- Selective compile in `watch` mode :zap:\n- Support for [multiple environments](https://spike.readme.io/docs/environments)\n- Interactive Project Starters via [sprout](https://github.com/carrot/sprout)\n- [Spike Plugins](https://npms.io/search?term=spikeplugin) for common integrations\n\n## Installation\n\n- `npm install spike-core -S`\n\n## Usage\n\nSpike operates through a carefully crafted javascript interface. If you are looking to use spike through its command line interface, check out [spike](https://github.com/static-dev/spike). This project is just the core javascript API.\n\n[**Check out the documentation for the Javascript API here**](https://spike.readme.io/docs/javascript-api)\n",
